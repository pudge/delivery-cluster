# Install all the prerequisites on the build-node

# The gem deps will be installed on a `cache` directory

# Destroy the old Delivery Cluster
#
# The current clycle for this cookbook is to destroy the old cluster we
# have running and then create a brand new one from scratch.
# For now are using a temporal cache directory outside of the workspace
# to save the state of our clusters and don't loose control, therefore
# the first thing we do is move the data back to the repository path
# before we trigger the destroy_all rake task.
#
# TODO: We need to figure a better way to do this

# Create a new Delivery Cluster
#
# Once we have deleted our old cluster it is time to build a new one from
# scratch. At the moment there are many problems in chef-provisioning that
# causes delivery-cluster to fail randomly, therefor instead of failing
# immediatelly we will try to run the automation multiple times (5) until
# we succeed. Every time that the cluster setup fails we will display the
# error to keep records and to be able to create the pertinent issues and
# get them fixed.
# In the future this loop should be deleted and delivery-cluster should
# work without the need of re-run multiple times.
#
# After we completed or failed to setup the new cluster we must backup the
# critical data directories to be able to manipulate the cluster on further
# changes and pipelines.
